### Future airdropper flow:

If you'd like to deploy your own zk airdrop up to a million people, all you need to do is change the merkle root and the message you have users sign ('zk-airdrop' for us), and redeploy our code. We precalculate the hours-long memory-intensive zkey computation for you, and the rest of the logic works out-of-the-box.
