# Run your own remote SNARK prover

If you don't trust our prover (as you should not!), you can run your own prover using the server folder in our repository: [zk-node-server](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/stealthdrop/tree/main/zk-node-server). You can run this set up locally or remotely -- know that you will need a _lot_ of RAM and disk to be able to run the proving server. Once you have the docker container running locally, you can spin a copy of the frontend locally (more instructions in [zkaffold-eth](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/stealthdrop/blob/main/zkaffold-eth/README.md)) and edit the value of [`backendUrl`](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/stealthdrop/blob/26ddc41056d3d8aa21aadc52edf4510802b3cbe7/zkaffold-eth/packages/react-app/src/components/Withdraw.jsx#L21) to use your own backend. 

# Set up your own airdrop

If you'd like to deploy your own zk airdrop up to a million people, all you need to do is change the merkle root and the message you have users sign ('zk-airdrop' for us), and redeploy our code. We precalculate the hours-long memory-intensive zkey computation for you, and the rest of the logic works out-of-the-box.

To set up your own airdrop, you can simply put the list of addresses in [this list](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/stealthdrop/blob/main/zkaffold-eth/packages/react-app/src/AirdropData.js#L21) and use the value of the obtained merkle tree root as a deployment argument to your contract (our own script is [here](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/stealthdrop/blob/main/zkaffold-eth/packages/hardhat/scripts/deploy.js)). Next, you'll want to edit the message claim hash. To do so, choose a different message and edit the value [here](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/stealthdrop/blob/a539a9c471f4f1bb309e7a684d34b4742d97bcf9/zkaffold-eth/packages/circom/scripts/test_generator.js#L97) and [here](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/stealthdrop/blob/26ddc41056d3d8aa21aadc52edf4510802b3cbe7/zkaffold-eth/packages/react-app/src/components/Withdraw.jsx#L18). Use the hash generated by the circuit as the respective deploy arguments.

Feel free to contact us if you have any trouble with any of these steps.
